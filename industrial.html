title: Industrial Design by Neil Baxter

      I have been designing and consulting across a number of industries; from product manufacturing, to oil and energy industries. I am experienced in a multitude of materials and composites. My goal is to find ways of replacing toxic non-sustainable materials with healthy sustainable options, often out of context, that improve efficiency, cut costs and improve the carbon footprint of manufacturing.
