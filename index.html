      I am a freelance sports and industrial designer with a strong interest in ecological design. I began my career designing sports hardware and have designed the Lendal and Double Dutch kayaks, canoes and paddles for the last 30 years. My designs have changed the shape of the sport and won many Olympic and World Titles.

      I am a keen sportsman and have kayaked the Grand Canyon many times. I love outdoor sports, whether it's snowboarding, cycling or kayaking.
